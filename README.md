Fork or clone the repository.

You'll need to set up an OpenAI account, and add your OpenAI API key to your shell. You can follow the instructions from OpenAI [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart).

Then just run the main function, e.g. `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`, depending on how your python aliasing is set up.

I also have the file aliased in my .zshrc file, so I can just call 'airegex' from anywhere.

_~/.zshrc_<br>
`alias airegex="python3 ~/<your_path>/airegex/main.py"`
